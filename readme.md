#Problem :----

- Given a singly linked list, write a function which takes in the first node in a singly linked list and returns a boolean indicating if the linked list contains a "CYCLE".
- A cycle is when a node's next point actually points back to a previous node in the list. This is also known as a circularly linked list.
